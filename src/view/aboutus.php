		<p>
		                    Established in 2005, The Exotic Fruit Company aims to provide businesses and consumers with fair prices and unique offerings.
                    We want to provide you or your business with fresh products and a selection you canâ€™t find elsewhere online.
                    The Exotic Fruit Company is owned by four second-generation grocers so you can count on friendly, knowledgeable customer-service and quality products.
                    We desire to support organic, Fairtrade producers. Our product range has been personally selected from farmers who meet these qualities.
                    We have selected these small-scale producers who are Fairtrade and organic certified to ensure that they meet our ethical and health-conscious guidelines.
